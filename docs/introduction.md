### What is Generative AI?
Generative AI refers to a class of machine learning models that generate new data based on learned patterns from existing datasets. It spans applications such as:
- Image generation (e.g., GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models)
- Text generation (e.g., Large Language Models like GPT)
- Music composition and style transfer

### Why Generative AI Matters
Generative models have transformed multiple fields, enabling:
- Content creation for artists and designers
- Advanced automation in industries like gaming and marketing
- Breakthroughs in medical imaging and drug discovery
