## Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Overview
LLMs are deep learning models trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human-like text.

### Key Aspects
- **Transformer Architecture:** Uses self-attention mechanisms to model long-range dependencies.
- **Pretraining & Fine-tuning:** Models learn general language representations before being specialized.
- **Use Cases:** Chatbots, code generation, automated writing.
