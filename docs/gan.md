## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

### Overview
GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete to produce realistic data.

### Key Components
- **Generator:** Creates fake data to fool the discriminator.
- **Discriminator:** Distinguishes real data from generated data.
- **Training Process:** The generator improves until its outputs are indistinguishable from real data.
